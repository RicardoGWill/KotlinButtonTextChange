# KotlinButtonTextChange
This is my first Kotlin app.  It is simple, but I am learning some new techniques.  I am using the Button's ID directly from the XML file instead of using the "findViewByID()" method.  The Gradle had this ability applied automatically, so I could immediately start with the app.  I put a button in the center of the screen that says "Click to change text".  In Kotlin, I use an "if" statement to change the text of the Button to say "Click to revert text" if the Button currently says "Click to change text".  Otherwise, the text is changed back to "Click to change text".  It works!
